   <h2>TETRIS</h2>
   <p class="intro">
      Tetris is one of the simplest yet most addictive puzzle games ever created. The player must rotate and 
        position falling geometric shapes called Tetrominoes to form complete horizontal lines. Completed lines
        disappear, freeing up space and gradually increasing the game’s speed. 
        What makes Tetris brilliant is its elegant balance:
        Simple rules (fit pieces into place)
        Complex outcomes (spatial reasoning, timing, and anticipation)
        Endless replayability, as the game progressively becomes faster and more demanding.

     <h2>FOOTBALL MANAGER 2026</h2>
     <p class="intro">
        The core management loop remains strong: taking charge of a club, organising the squad, handling tactics and
        transfers still delivers plenty of satisfaction. Many reviewers note that the “magic” moments of turning around
        a club or pulling off a big deal remain intact. Technical overhaul: FM 26 uses the Unity engine (a noted step change)
        which allows for upgraded visuals — better stadium lighting, more realistic 3D presentations, dynamic weather effects in matches. 
        Replayability remains very high: For fans of the simulation genre, there’s still a deep sandbox aspect. If you enjoy the
        long-term strategic play, the game provides that. Some reviewers believe this is a “foundation” title that sets
        up future iterations, with promise of deeper systems under the hood.

     <h2>CALL OF DUTY</h2>
     <p class="intro">
        The core gunplay remains very solid. Reviewers say the shooting feels great, with strong responsiveness and satisfying feedback. 
        Multiplayer remains the main attraction. According to Tom’s Guide:“Its excellent multiplayer suite is the biggest draw…” 
        The Zombies mode also gets praise. The Tech Vortex notes a “nostalgic return with depth”, merging past CoD Zombies
        elements and adding new ones. Technical performance: Good across modern platforms, with accessibility features.
        For players who value smooth FPS and decent visuals, this is a plus.

     <h2>WARCRAFT III: REIGN OF CHAOS</h2>
     <p class="intro">
         “Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos” is a real-time strategy (RTS) game developed by Blizzard Entertainment,
         released in 2002. It’s the third major title in the Warcraft universe, featuring four playable factions
        (Humans, Orcs, Undead, Night Elves), a strong campaign narrative, hero-units, base-building, unit management and multiplayer. 
        What works / strong points
        The game was very highly regarded on release: on Metacritic it scores 92/100 indicating “universal acclaim”. 
        Story and characters stand out: memorable moments with characters like Arthas Menethil, Thrall, Illidan Stormrage.
        The narrative is more cinematic than many RTS games of its time.Deep and engaging gameplay: hero units
        (which gain experience) add an RPG-flavour to the RTS genre; each faction plays differently, campaigns are varied.

     <h2>GRAND THEFT AUTO V</h2>
     <p class="intro">
       What works very well
       The game received universal acclaim from critics. On Metacritic, it holds a score of 97/100 for many platforms. 
       The open-world design is massive and immersive: you explore the fictional city of Los Santos and its surrounding 
       areas, with lots of detail, atmosphere and things to do. Character and narrative structure: The game allows you
       to play as three protagonists (Michael, Franklin, Trevor) which is relatively unusual and adds variety to story and gameplay. 
       Mission design & variety: Heists, driving, shooting, exploring, side-activities — the gameplay mix is strong. 
       Many reviewers point out how GTA V raises the bar for open-world games. Longevity & online component: The inclusion
       of Grand Theft Auto Online gives the game extended life beyond the single‐player campaign. Also, the richness
       of the world means replay value is high. User reviews reflect long-term enjoyment.
